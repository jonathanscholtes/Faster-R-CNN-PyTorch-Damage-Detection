# Faster R-CNN for Container and Damage Detection

  This project details an end-to-end solution that harnesses Faster R-CNN to tackle two key challenges in the shipping and logistics sectors: Container Detection and Damage Detection. By leveraging PyTorch for implementing Faster R-CNN with VGG16 and ResNet50 backbones, the system  identifies shipping containers and assesses them for damages; code is for article: [Faster R-CNN Unleashed: Crafting an End-to-End Solution for Damage Detection](https://stochasticcoder.com/2023/11/20/faster-r-cnn-unleashed-crafting-an-end-to-end-solution-for-damage-detection/).
  
  
   ### Features 
   :large_blue_diamond: **[Container Detection](containerDetection)**: Identify and localize shipping containers in varied environments using Faster R-CNN with a VGG16 backbone. 
   
   :large_blue_diamond: **[Damage Detection](damageDetection)**: After container detection, the system checks for damages using a ResNet50 based Faster R-CNN, distinguishing between actual damage and superficial markings like logos or text.

   ### Applications 
   - **Logistics Management**: Enhance tracking and quality assurance in logistics by accurately logging container conditions. 
   - **Security and Insurance**: Automate the assessment of container integrity for security purposes or insurance claims.
